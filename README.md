# Poke - Beta Release
Text messages from Android to Windows Desktop Application and back.

## How does it work?
- Connect both your computer and phone to the same network (via wifi is fine).
- Start the Windows Desktop App
- Start the Android App.
- In the Android App, click *Find Devices*
- After a few moments, the name, ip address and port of the computer you started the desktop app on should appear.
- In the Android App select the device.
- After a few moments you should be given a passcode to type into the computer, this ensures that you are the one connecting to the device and not someone from afar.
- After successfully typing in the passcode the desktop app navigates to the main screen with the *No Conversations* text.
- You can now just wait for text messages or start your own conversations by pressing the *+* button to view your contacts.
